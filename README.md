# My Awesome Project

I built an API for ski resorts that I had visited using express as my framework. I hosted the project on cyclish.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express, Node.js

Having just build a different project with the core modules of node.js, I was just introducted to beauty of Express. This project was to experiment and learn how to use the Express framework.

## Optimizations

- Visual optimizations and design front end.
- Add additional resorts and details.

- Add backend architecture - MVC
- Create accounts for different users to add resorts they've visted.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great project that further my understanding of express and node.js, how to build API's, use CORS with my API,
